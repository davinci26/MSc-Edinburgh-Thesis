\abstract{%
With the number of Internet-of-Things devices increasing at an exponential rate, the need for secure and efficient firmware updates becomes a necessity. Additionally, the costs required to maintain the infrastructure that could serve firmware updates efficiently to large sets of users are a significant financial burden for small IoT device manufacturers. Furthermore, the current firmware update schemes do not allow open-source development, of firmware if the manufacturers decide to stop maintaining a device.

In the present work, we propose and implement a decentralized firmware update framework called Código network. For Código network, we set the following requirements: (i) no single point of failure, (ii) equivalent security with code signing, (iii) transparency of firmware updates and (iv) scalability. To fulfill the aforementioned requirements, Código network is implemented on top of the Ethereum blockchain and the IPFS network. In our developed system, developers upload firmware to a  repository, implemented as a Ethereum decentralized application. In parallel, users can browse the repository for trusted firmware and download the firmware. To encapsulate trust in a decentralized network, we develop an open-source implementation of Web-of-Trust as an Ethereum smart-contract. 

The performance of Código network is quantified based on two criteria. The first criterion is the transaction costs entailed in the operation of the Ethereum smart contracts. The second criterion is the time required to distribute a new firmware to a set of users. To evaluate it we compared Código network with the Client-Server model and BitTorrent. The simulation tool we developed is under code review in order to be added in the IPFS test framework.
